# Optional: Backend API base URL (no trailing slash). Used in production only.
# - In dev we always use Vite proxy (/api -> backend) to avoid CORS.
# - In production: leave UNSET so Netlify proxies /api/* to the backend (no CORS).
#   Only set this if your backend allows CORS from your frontend origin:
#   VITE_API_BASE=https://www.itcatalystindia.com/Development/CustomerPortal_API
